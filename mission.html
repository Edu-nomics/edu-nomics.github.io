							<h3>Our Approach</h3>
							<p>To bring economics, business, and finance to inspired middle school students who wish to gain experience with such diverse, prospective fields early in their lives.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Economics: </b>Terms like GDP, interest rates, etc. are always tossed around on the news. We want our students to understand basic terminology as well as key concepts such as supply and demand and the money market.</li>
								<li><b>Business: </b>Understanding others' viewpoints is critical in all aspects of life, even outside business. We want our students to understand value proposition and learn how to pitch products effectively.</li>
								<li><b>Finance: </b>Finance is one of the most competitive fields out there. We want to equip our students early on with the skills needed to thrive in situations from personal investments to Wall Street.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Topics We Cover</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Supply and Demand: </b>This simple tool is extremely powerful in visualizing how certain changes in the economy can effect price level. Learn how to utilize the supply and demand graph to make relationships and predict prices.</li>
								<li><b>GDP: </b>Usually, GDP is used as a measurement to compare how countries are growing economically. Learn what components affect GDP and how it relates to supply and demand.</li>
								<li><b>Unemployment: </b>All countries experience unemployment yet minimizing it is extremely hard. Learn what makes unemployment a difficult challenge to combat and how it exacerbates.</li>
								<li><b>Money: </b>Money drives the economy. Learn about how the Federal Reserve regulates money and the challenges associated with stabilizing the money market.</li>
								<li><b>Inflation: </b>Inflation is commonly misunderstood as something harmful to economic health. Learn in which situations inflation is beneficial and harmful.</li>
								<li><b>Foreign Exchange Market: </b>Countries have their own currencies. Learn how each country's currency is affected by the value of other currencies.</li>
							</ul>
